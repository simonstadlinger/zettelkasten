# Barbell

Is an investment strategy. It is applicable to a fixed income portfolio. It consists of half long term bonds (> 10 years) and half short term bonds (< 5 years).
It attempts to have the best of both worlds, which is having high yields from long bonds, and flexibility with short term bonds.
