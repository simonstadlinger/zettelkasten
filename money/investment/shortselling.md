# Shortselling

Is a trading strategy.
You "bet" on the decline of a stock / asset, so that it is going to lose value.
Lets say stock from company A currently trades for 75\$. You lend 100 stocks from your broker and sell them on the open market. With this you make 7500\$. 
Then the price drops to 40\$. You then buy 100 stocks from company A back, for 40\$*100=4000\$. The difference between your selling in the first place and the rebuy when later on to give it back to your broker is your win. In this case its 3500\$.
