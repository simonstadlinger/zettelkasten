# The Content of the knowledge body of a zettel

Write in your own words. Write in a way that your future self will understand it without having that much of a context.
Mostly your zettel should not contain more than three sentences, but this heavily depends on the type of content you are producing. Anyways, do not try to exceed three sentences.
When linking to stuff in the body of the zettel, try to give some context to the link as seen in [[structure-of-a-zettel]].
