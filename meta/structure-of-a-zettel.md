# The stucture of a zettel

 A zettel consists out of three (four) parts
 - Identifier / Heading (Unique Identifier, sometimes with timestamp, sometimes with unique nummer, sometimes with spellable string)
 - The knowledge body, what you actually want to capture, following [[content-of-body]]
 - References (Where you get it from / Book, article, etc.) This sometimes can be your own reference, when writing a [[permanent-note]]
 - (And they contain tags which is an additional way of structuring and organizing knowledge).
