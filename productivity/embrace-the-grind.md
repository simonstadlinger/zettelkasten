# Embrace the Grind

Something you achieve can seem magical to others, but has solely to do with putting in the effort nobody else would have put in.
This can be extremely boring work - And because its so boring, nobody would want to do it, and therefore it seems like magic if somebody else actually does it. 

Example: Software drowns in c.a. 3000 bugs, guy spends weeks sorting, labeling, tagging and prioritizing bugs, one year in software has no more bugs, everybody says he has achieved the impossible. But he just has done the necessary and boring work
