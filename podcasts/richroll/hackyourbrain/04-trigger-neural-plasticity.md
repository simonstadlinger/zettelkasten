# Trigger neural plasticity as an adult

The brain can change after age 25. 
Provided that there is (first) focus.
When one focuses and thinking and executing deliberately, 
Acetylcholin is released and marks neurons for change. This *triggeres* neural plasticity. It *happens* in phases of deep rest and sleep.
