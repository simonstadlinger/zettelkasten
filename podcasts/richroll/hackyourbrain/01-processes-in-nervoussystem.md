# 01 Processes that the nervous system orchestrates

Nervoussystem is responsible for orchestrating generally 5 things within the body.
- *sensation*: Everything we have a receptor for, we receife, wether we want to or not (Photons -> Eye).
- *perception*: Every sensation we want to focus on or we pay attention to, kind of the spotlight of attention.
- *feelings*: Sensations in the body, concepts in the mind.
- *thoughts*: Thoughts can happen spontaniously like a brower popup, or planned / "delieberate".
- *behaviours / actions*
