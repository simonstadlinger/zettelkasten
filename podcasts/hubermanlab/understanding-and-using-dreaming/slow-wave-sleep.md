# Slow wave sleep

Slow wave sleep as opposed to [[rem-sleep]], occurs more frequent early in the night, than later in the night.
In this sleep phase, learning of new **motor skills** on one hand and **details of any event** (language, movement) on the other hand occur.
A good combination of both would be learning the piano.
