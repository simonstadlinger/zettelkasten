# Coding Dojo

When: When a software team is in the storming phase
Goals: Get a mutual understanding of each others programming style, assimilate programming style, learn new techniques in a group (e.g. TDD)
How: Set up a kata (imagined user story, product frame) (e.g. develop elevator controlling software), each team member gets 5 minutes of coding, then hands over mouse and keyboard to the next one. While one is programming, nobody is allowed to interrupt, correct, criticize him/her. One can make changes he likes, when he has mouse and keyboard control. The coding dojo master acts like a PO and advisor
Who: Scrum master or other people in a developer team.
