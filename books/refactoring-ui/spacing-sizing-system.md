# Establish a spacing and sizing system

Limit yourself to a restricted set of values. Do not choose values from a linear scale (increase of 4 px for example). Choose on a relational scale, for example in 25% increases.

Example of size system:
Start with 16 px, can be divided properly and is default font for web browser.

Choose values from that scale when for example deciding for a margin.
