# HSL

HSL represents color using attributes the human eye can see:
- hue: colors position on the color wheel. It is measured in degrees, where 0° is red, 120° is green, 240° is blue.

- saturation: how vivid the color looks, 0% saturation is grey. Desaturated, every hue looks the same.

IMPORTANT: Browsers only understand HSL. Not HSB.
