# Define your shades up front

![](../../attachments/2021-02-20-11-56-24.png)

Don't use css preprocessors.
Pick by hand.

For one hue (primary, accent, grey):

Start with base primary color shade, something that would look good on a button.

Choose the edges, based on how they would look like in action, for example on a alert window.

FIll in the gaps, by first filling the quarter shades, and then the rest.

Again, its not about math, its about what looks good.
