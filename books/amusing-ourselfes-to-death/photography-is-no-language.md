# Photography is no language

It is often talked about a "language" of photography. Postman points out, that this is dangerous for the following reasons:
- Language handles abstractions like nature. Photography can only express a concrete instance of nature like a lake. Photography can also not talk about other concepts as truth or honor. 
- Language presents the world by ideas of "man", "trees" since there is a infinite variety of instances of those things, Photography only as objects and concrete instances.
  > Photography needs to be recognized, Language to be understood
- Photography can not offer opinions, "might have beens", no discussions. Only shows concrete slice of space time.
- "True", "False" come from the space of language, a photography (not edited) can not argue about "true", or "false".
- Photography does not require context, it takes things out of context. Language mostly only makes sense in context, in a sequential ordering of thoughts.
