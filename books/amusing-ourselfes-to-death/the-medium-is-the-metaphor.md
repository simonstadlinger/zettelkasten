# The Medium is the Metaphor

In this chapter Postman argues, that only through the form we communicate information, our worldview is shaped. As nearly everything is formulated as an abstraction and using metaphores as description, the capability of our understanding of the world is tightly coupled with the technical capabilities of the medium we use to communicate. 

> We do not see nature or intelligence or human motivation or ideology as “it” is but only as our languages are. And our languages are our media. Our media are our metaphors. Our metaphors create the content of our culture. *Postman, Neil. Amusing Ourselves to Death (p. 15). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.*
