# Let your people do their stuff

Sometimes things go bad. For example a kid gets eaten at a Park of the company you are the head of. Then you have to rely on and trust the people around you that they do their job. Apply an internal thread scale wether to engage or let things go, because there is nothing you can do, even though you are "in charge".
Approach bad news as a problem that can be solved.
