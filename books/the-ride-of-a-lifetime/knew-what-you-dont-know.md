# Know what you don't know

There is not that much more to say. Even as a boss, don't be foolish to believe that just because you are boss, you know everything. Chances are, that you are the person who knows the least about the specificity of something in the room when you are the boss of the room. You have to trust the people around you and in giving them trust, you empower them.
