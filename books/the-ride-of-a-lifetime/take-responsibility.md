# Take responsibility

In a team meeting, [[bob-igler]]s boss was furious and wanted to know whose fault it was that something went wrong like this. Bob rose his hand and admitted that he was responsible for what happened. Everybody was kind of shocked, since nobody has ever admitted something was their fault.

His boss treated him from now on with higher respect. 
The lesson to learn from that is that
1.  You have to take responsibility for your actions in order to keep integrity and ultimately *authority*. It helps people trust in you. 
2.  With that behavior built a culture of responsibility and honesty.
