# Life the culture

Bob tells the story of the two executives Thomas Murphy and Daniel Burke of Capital Cities when it acquired ABC Media. They where always themselves, treated people with respect, guided by a clear sense of right and wrong - they where integer. 

They where not only shredded business people who knew the numbers, but lived the integrity. 
The interesting thing is, bob gives not only the business decisions credit for the successful transformation of ABC Operations, but also to the way they lived their values which over time reflects in the company and how people behave.

> In fact, true integrity—a sense of knowing who you are and being guided by your own clear sense of right and wrong—is a kind of secret weapon.
