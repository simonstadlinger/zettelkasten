# Man in the Car Paradox

Key insight: When seeing people with fancy cars you don't think "wow this person is rich, this person is cool". What you actually think in most cases is "wow, how would I be perceived sitting in that car? Wouldn't I come accross wealthy?". And that is exactly the thing people thing when looking at you in a fancy car.

> Humility, Kindness and empathy will bring you more respect than any horsepower ever will
