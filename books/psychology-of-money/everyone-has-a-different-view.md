# Everyone has a different view

Everybody experiences money different. Your relationship with money highly depends on what you experienced when you grew up, e.g. when you witnessed that stocks can have high interest rates, you are likely to have a more positive view on this topic than someone who experienced the stock crash vividly, because his or her parents lost almost everything.
