# Thinking is a Deliverable - improve it

John D. Rockefellers company was wildly successful. He was a quiet man who often just sat there and thought. Back in the days where almost all of the work was done manually and with hard body work involved this was special. But his deliverable was not the wall other workers would build with their bare hands, his deliverable was making good decisions. 

*Thinking and making good decisions is a deliverable*

You have to improve your capability of thinking and making good decisions. Your tools is not a shovel, but its the head. Take care of it. Its your asset.
