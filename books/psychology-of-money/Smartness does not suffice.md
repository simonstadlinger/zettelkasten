# Smartness does not suffice

Smartness alone does not make you stand out. In a very connected world where people can be hired from all over the world, companies have a large talent pool to choose from. 
The important advantage now is **flexibility**, next to communication or empathy and other soft skills. 
Flexibility allows you to wait for a good opportunity. You have the power to decide to learn a new skill if its necessary, and do not feel the urge to chase others to keep up.
