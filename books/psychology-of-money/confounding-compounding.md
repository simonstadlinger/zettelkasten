# Confounding Compounding

This chapter tells the analogy between the ice age and Warren Buffets success. 
The ice ages where possible because slight changes in earths vertical axis angle caused by gravity pull / pushes of moon and sun, led to snow that has fallen in winter to last during the summer, which led to more snow during the next summer and one and one. A few centuries later the whole earth was covered in ice.

> It begins when a summer never gets warm enough to melt the previous winters snow.

Warren Buffet stuck to his investing strategy since he was a 10. From his net worth of $84.5 billion, $84.2 billion where accumulated after his 50th birthday. His secret is that he has been an investor for almost 75 years. If he had started with 30 and a base of $25.000 he'd be worth $11.9 *million* at the age of 60.

> Investing is his skill, time his secret.

The seemingly unlogical mathmatical logic of compounding is capable of insane results. And because it seems not logical to us, we try to solve the problem in another way.
