*Key Insight*: The best thing money can do is buy you time and the freedom to decide for yourself

---

Angus Campbell investigated what makes people happy and summarized it by having control over their life and decisions.

Another insight: 
Even doing something you actually love doing when you can't control when you have to do it, can feel like doing something you don't like. Like being forced to design a Logo when you are not in the mood, but it has a deadline attached to it. Its called [[reactance]].

Another insight:
[[Thinking is a Deliverable - improve it]]

---

Karl Pillemer, a gerontologist (Science of aging), dealt with many very old people and asking all of them what their advice would be for young and ambitious people they never - not a single one of them - mentioned that you should work as hard as you can to get money and buy the things you like. 

> What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children.
