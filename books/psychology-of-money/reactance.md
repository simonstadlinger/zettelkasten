# Reactance (Psychology)

Is the response somebody has, when his or her freedom to do something or to not do something is threatened. Often times this leads to now even more wanting to do the thing which is threatened or for which now there is no time left. The german "jetzt erst recht" fits that defiance mood the person is in pretty good.
